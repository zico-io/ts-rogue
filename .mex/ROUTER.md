# Session Bootstrap

If you haven't already read `AGENTS.md`, read it now — it contains the project identity, non-negotiables, and commands.

Then read this file fully before doing anything else in this session.

## Current Project State

**Working:**
- Full terminal game loop (Ink): title/class select, village, overworld,
  first-person dungeon, turn-based battle, loot, save/load, permadeath.
- Deterministic engine: seeded RNG, reducer + GameStore, combat with
  rows/status/target-shapes, loot with affixes, Guild quests, fast travel.
- Skill tree: data model, passive stat aggregation, battle skill menu, and the
  Skill Tree UI (view nodes/prerequisites, spend points) — ENG-33.
- PixiJS browser renderer (`src/web`): all four playing scenes have real
  content, atlas/art pipeline, IndexedDB save, dev console + crash overlay,
  Next.js portal chrome, deployed alongside the eve agent.

**Not yet built:**
- Browser `SettingsScreen` (terminal has one; selecting Settings in the web
  title is stashed/logged).
- Animated Minifantasy spell-effect sprite sheets (particles stand in behind
  the same factory seam).
- Harness data-access routes are behind a hard 401 until a real superadmin
  auth check lands (HAR-54).
- Starter skill-tree node content (data model shipped; content in ENG-35).

**Known issues:**
- Harness observability queries degrade to `{ unavailable }` until the Vercel
  team gets Observability Plus; the exact groupBy shape is unverified.

## Routing Table

Load the relevant file based on the current task. Always load `context/architecture.md` first if not already in context this session.

| Task type | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Understanding how the system works | `context/architecture.md` |
| Game rules / state / combat / loot / skills / quests / persistence | `context/engine.md` |
| PixiJS browser renderer / atlas / Next chrome | `context/web-renderer.md` |
| Working with a specific technology | `context/stack.md` |
| Writing or reviewing code | `context/conventions.md` |
| Making a design decision | `context/decisions.md` |
| Setting up or running the project | `context/setup.md` |
| Any specific task | Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern |

## Behavioural Contract

For every task, follow this loop:

1. **CONTEXT** — Load the relevant context file(s) from the routing table above. Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern. If one exists, follow it. Narrate what you load: "Loading architecture context..."
2. **BUILD** — Do the work. If a pattern exists, follow its Steps. If you are about to deviate from an established pattern, say so before writing any code — state the deviation and why.
3. **VERIFY** — Load `context/conventions.md` and run the Verify Checklist item by item. State each item and whether the output passes. Do not summarise — enumerate explicitly.
4. **DEBUG** — If verification fails or something breaks, check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a debug pattern. Follow it. Fix the issue and re-run VERIFY.
5. **GROW** — After meaningful work, run this binary checklist:
   - **Ground:** What changed in reality? Name the changed behavior, system, command, dependency, or workflow.
   - **Record:** If project state changed, update the "Current Project State" section above. If documented facts changed, update the relevant `context/` file surgically.
   - **Orient:** If this task can recur and no pattern exists, create one in `patterns/` using `patterns/README.md`, then add it to `patterns/INDEX.md`. If a pattern exists but you learned a gotcha, update it.
   - **Write:** Bump `last_updated` in every scaffold file you changed. If the why matters, run `mex log --type decision "<what changed and why>"` or `mex log "<note>"`.
